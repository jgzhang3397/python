# Make a dictionary called favorite_places. 
# Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, 
# and store one to three favorite places for each person. 
# To make this exercise a bit more interesting, 
# ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. 
# Loop through the dictionary, 
# and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
